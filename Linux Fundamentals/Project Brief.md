# LINUX FUNDAMENTALS | PROJECT: INFO EXTRACTOR

## OPERATION ORDER
Operation Info Extractor is a straight-to-the-point mission with one clear goal: "Gather System Info". This task involves creating a smart script to dig into the system and pull out key details. You'll need to find out network info like IP and MAC addresses, check how the system is running by looking at CPU and memory use, and figure out which files and folders are the biggest. Your mission is to do this neatly and efficiently, giving us a clear picture of what's going on inside the system.

**1. VISION**
To empower users with optimisation of their digital environments, providing tools for enhanced understanding and security. We aim to simplify complex diagnostics into actionable ones.

**2. MISSION**
Simplify complex system diagnostics, ensuring enhanced security and performance.

**3. STRATEGY**
Use an online website such as app.diagrams.net and create a schema of your network.

**4. OBJECTIVES**
- Create intuitive tools, making them accessible to users of all skill levels.
- Educate users on the system's health and security.
- Continuously improve and update our offerings in response to evolving technology and user feedback.

## Project Structure

### System Diagnostics
    1. Identify the system's public IP.
    2. Identify the private IP address assigned to the system's network interface.
    3. Display the MAC address (masking sensitive portions for security).
    4. Display the percentage of CPU usage for the top 5 processes.
    5. Display memory usage statistics: total and available memory.
    6. List active system services with their status.
    7. Locate the Top 10 Largest Files in /home.
