# INTRO TO CYBER | PROJECT: NET CRAFTS

## OPERATION ORDER
Operation Net Crafts is a two-phased reconnaissance mission.
Phase 1, "Network Mapping", commands a detailed survey of the internal network terrain, identifying all devices, their communication protocols, and strategic infrastructure points.
Phase 2, "External Intel Gathering", deploys digital surveillance via Shodan and WHOIS, examining the network's public presence and analysing traffic for operational security.
Execute with precision to secure a comprehensive battlefield overview.

**1. VISION**
Understanding the network, the devices in it, and the role of each of them.

**2. MISSION**
Map the network and understand the role of each device on your network.

**3. STRATEGY**
Use an online website such as app.diagrams.net and create a schema of your network.

**4. OBJECTIVES**
- Find all your IP addresses at home, including MAC addresses.
- Include the DNS and DHCP devices.
- Collect all the details about your ISP and public IP address in Shodan and Whois.

## Project Structure

### 1. Map the Network
     1.1. Display Devices IP Address
     1.2. Display Devices MAC Address and Vendor (display partially)
     1.3. Display the Router's Internal and External IP Addresses (display partially)
     1.4. Display the DNS and DHCP IP Addresses in your Network
     1.5. Display your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
     1.6. Display if the Device is Connected via Ethernet or Wireless

### 2. Collecting Information
     2.1. Use Shodan to Check Your Public IP Address
     2.2. Use WHOIS to Check Who is Registered on Your Public IP Address
     2.3. Sniff Your Network and Identify Three (3) Used Protocols
     2.3.1. For Each Protocol Explain Its Usage
     2.3.2. For Each Protocol, Find the Used Port Number
